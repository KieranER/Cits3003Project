# Cits3003Project

Project for CITS3003 (Team 23; Student IDs: 20742973, 21488841)

Designed for usage on MACs

Included files are:
1. project itself (with files in correct places for running)
2. Gus.blend 	the blender file for the gingerbreadman
3. Ccube.blend 	the blender file for KR's individual model/animation.

A note about the blender files: Due to the bugs implementing them, to view correctly in blender, you may have to scale the objects down by 25.
They were changed to ensure the .x file correctly showed in the scene editor, and no significant attempt was made to undo the bug that plagued them.
